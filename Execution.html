                    <ul>
                        <li>This trial commenced in July 1929.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>In the Lahore prison where they were lodged, the young leaders started a hunger strike demanding better treatment as they were supposed to be political prisoners.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>They were met by many leaders including Jawaharlal Nehru, who expressed pain on seeing their distress.</li> 
                        <br>
                        <li>Bhagat Singh fasted for 116 days after which he ended it at the request of his father and Congress leaders.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The trial, needless to say, was one-sided and Bhagat Singh, along with Rajguru and Sukhdev were sentenced to death.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The trial and the subsequent sentence drew widespread condemnation from many quarters.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Many national leaders requested a reduced sentence but to no avail.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The trio was ordered to be hanged on 24 March 1931 but the sentence was carried out a day earlier at the Lahore Jail. After the hanging, their mortal remains were cremated in secret.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>It is said that Bhagat Singh cried 'Down with British imperialism' as he was hanged.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>This execution evoked strong reactions from the Indian people, particularly youngsters, and many were motivated to join the freedom struggle.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>23rd March is observed as 'Martyrs' Day' or 'Shaheed Diwas' or 'Sarvodaya Day' in honour of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev.</li>
